# Currency-rate-tracker
The following uses the selenium web-scraper library to track, in real time, two currencies against one another before generating graphics and stats to send to the user.
I have copied two examples - an image developed via matplotlib - and a neatly arranged list of lists, which represent the relevant data visually
and numerically. The user can receive these via email. The numerical data is uploaded in real-time to a .txt file. The user can specify the time-period
during which she or he wants the program to run. Rather than using, say, the beautiful soup library, I liked the idea of tapping into second-by-second
information that changed as the program ran.
